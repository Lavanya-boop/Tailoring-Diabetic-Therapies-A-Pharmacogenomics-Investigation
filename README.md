## Project Overview

This repository contains resources for the "Tailoring Diabetic Therapies: A Pharmacogenomics Investigation" project, aimed at creating a novel toolkit that helps endocrinologists deliver targeted drug therapy for Type II diabetes patients based on their genetic profiles.

The application leverages pharmacogenomic data to identify relationships between genetic variations and responses to common diabetes treatments such as metformin and sulfonylureas. This enables healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about medication selection and dosing, potentially reducing adverse effects and improving treatment outcomes.

## Project Goals

- Investigate connections between pharmacogenetics and Type II diabetes drug therapy
- Develop a rapid diagnostic tool for physicians to implement targeted therapy
- Identify genetic variations that affect patient response to common diabetes medications
- Enable preemptive genotyping to identify at-risk patients
- Improve patient outcomes through personalized medicine approaches
